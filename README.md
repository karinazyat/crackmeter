# crackmeter
This app allows data visualization from crackmeters, or rock monitoring devices, installed in five different national parks. Displacement over a rolling 24 hour average is calculated from raw data for both no temperature and temperature methods. The app also shows 24-hr rolling average temperature data, as well as normalized displacement values before the rolling average is applied. 
To use, either clone this repository or download the files and open the .proj file in RStudio, or use the published app link: https://kzyat.shinyapps.io/crackmeter/. To see how the app works, download the Zion_files or Hawaii_Nahuku_files, and upload the correct files as prompted for calibration and raw data, respectively. Have fun!
